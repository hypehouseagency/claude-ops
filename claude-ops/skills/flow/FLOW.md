# FLOW — The Canonical Lifecycle Map

> Single source of truth for **which command runs at each lifecycle stage**.
> The `/flow` router (`skills/flow/SKILL.md`) reads this file to dispatch.
> Three systems stay installed and self-updating; this map is the only
> place that decides who owns what. Edit here, not in three doctrines.

## The one routing rule: project-mode vs ad-hoc-mode

`/flow` picks the **abstraction level from repo state first**, then delegates
to the canonical tool. This single mechanism dissolves the worst collisions
(ship / build / review / orchestrate) — there is no forced "winner", the
router defaults correctly per context.

- **PROJECT-MODE** — the repo (or cwd's git root) has a `.planning/` directory.
  `/flow` drives the **GSD phase state machine**
  (`spec → discuss → plan → execute → verify → ship → milestone`). Each GSD
  phase *calls gstack / ops tools as sub-steps* (e.g. execute-phase invokes
  `/browse` for QA, `/design-html` for UI, `ops:ops-deploy` for rollout).
  **State + rigor come from GSD; the tools come from gstack / ops.**

- **AD-HOC-MODE** — no `.planning/` dir; a quick, stateless change.
  `/flow` runs the **gstack stateless lifecycle** directly
  (`/spec → build → /review → /qa → /ship`) with zero `.planning/` overhead.

- **OPS / COMMS / AUTONOMY** — claude-ops `/ops:*`. Always available
  orthogonally in **either** mode (inbox, fires, marketing, daemon, voice,
  finops, home). Never gated on repo state.

Detection contract: a repo is project-mode iff `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
resolves and `<toplevel>/.planning/` exists. Otherwise ad-hoc-mode. `bin/flow-state`
computes this and the "you are here" position.

## Canonical command per stage

For each stage exactly **one** canonical command runs. The rest are
"also invoked" (fired as sub-steps by the canonical) or "demoted"
(kept installed, but their `description:` is rewritten to name the canonical).

| Stage | Canonical | Also invoked (sub-steps) | Demoted → points at canonical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ideate** | gstack `/office-hours` | `ops:ops-yolo` (C-suite Hard Truths) | — |
| **spec** | gstack `/spec` (5-phase → GitHub issue → worktree agent) | feeds GSD engine | `gsd-spec-phase` (engine, not entrypoint) |
| **plan** | **GSD** `gsd-plan-phase` / `gsd-ultraplan-phase` (goal-backward, `.planning/PLAN.md`) wrapped by gstack `/autoplan` role reviews | `gsd-plan-review-convergence` | `/plan-*-review` (run via `/autoplan`); `giga plan` |
| **design** | gstack `/design-consultation` → `/design-shotgun` → `/design-html` | Pencil/Figma (DESIGN-FIRST rule) | — |
| **build** | project → **GSD** `gsd-execute-phase` (fresh-context waves) / `gsd-master-orchestrator` (multi-project, ≤5 subagents/action); ad-hoc → direct edits + worktree | worktree isolation (mandatory) | `ops:ops-orchestrate`, `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, personal `subagents`/`orchestrator` |
| **review** | gstack `/review` (pre-land) + `/cso` (security) | project also runs `gsd-code-review` (phase-gated → CODE-REVIEW.md) | standalone `code-review` / `security-review`; `gsd-review` |
| **test** | gstack `/qa` + `/browse` (web), `/ios-qa` (iOS) | project also runs `gsd-verify-work` + `gsd-add-tests` | standalone `e2e` |
| **ship** | project → **GSD** `gsd-ship` (phase→PR, `.planning`-filtered branch); ad-hoc single-repo → gstack `/ship`; multi-repo salvage → `ops:ops-merge` | `gsd-pr-branch` cleans the branch | `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` |
| **deploy** | claude-ops `ops:ops-deploy` + gstack `/land-and-deploy` → `/canary` | `ops:ops-deploy-fix` (autofix) | `/setup-deploy` (config only) |
| **monitor** | claude-ops `ops:ops-fires` + `ops:ops-status` + `ops:ops-monitor` | gstack `/health`, `/landing-report` | `gsd-health`, `gsd-progress`, personal `status` |
| **retro / learn** | gstack `/retro` + `/learn` | `gsd-extract-learnings` / `gsd-milestone-summary` at milestone close | `giga consolidate`; `ops:ops-recap` (kept) |
| **ops / comms** | **claude-ops `/ops:*` — SOLE OWNER** | — | personal `morning` / `wrap` → `ops-go`; `next` → `ops-next` |
| **project-state** | **GSD `.planning/` — SOLE OWNER**; `ops:ops-projects` is the read-only dashboard over it (via `gsd-registry-sync` cron) | `ops:ops-linear` syncs phases→Linear | personal `healify-gsd` |

## Router dispatch table (keyword → target)

`/flow <intent>` keyword-matches the first column; mode-sensitive rows
resolve via `bin/flow-state`. Mirrors the `/ops:ops` routing-table pattern.

| Intent keywords | Stage | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| (empty), map, here, where | — | print this map + `bin/flow-state` "you are here" |
| ideate, brainstorm, office-hours, hard-truths | ideate | `/office-hours` (+ `/ops:ops-yolo` if "hard truths") |
| spec, specify, scope, issue | spec | `/spec` |
| plan, roadmap, phase-plan | plan | project → `gsd-plan-phase`; ad-hoc → `/autoplan` |
| ultraplan, deep-plan | plan | `gsd-ultraplan-phase` |
| design, ui, mockup, html | design | `/design-consultation` |
| build, execute, implement, code | build | project → `gsd-execute-phase`; multi-project → `gsd-master-orchestrator`; ad-hoc → direct + worktree |
| review, code-review, cr | review | `/review` (+ `gsd-code-review` if project) |
| security, cso, sec-review | review | `/cso` |
| test, qa, e2e | test | `/qa` (+ `gsd-verify-work` if project) |
| ios-qa, ios-test | test | `/ios-qa` |
| ship, pr, land | ship | project → `gsd-ship`; ad-hoc → `/ship`; salvage → `/ops:ops-merge` |
| deploy, release, rollout | deploy | `/ops:ops-deploy` → `/canary` |
| canary | deploy | `/canary` |
| monitor, fires, incidents, status, health | monitor | `/ops:ops-fires` (+ `/ops:ops-status`) |
| retro, learn, reflect | retro | `/retro` (+ `/learn`) |
| ops, inbox, comms, marketing, finops, voice, home, daemon | ops | `/ops:ops $REST` (delegate whole arg to ops sub-router) |
| projects, portfolio, state | project-state | `/ops:ops-projects` |

When the intent is ambiguous between two stages, prefer the **earliest**
unfulfilled stage for the current `flow-state` position.
