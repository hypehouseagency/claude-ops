# Daemon Guide

*The unified background process manager that pre-warms briefings, syncs WhatsApp, extracts memories, and watches your fires — persistently, via launchd*

[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.1.0-blue)](../CHANGELOG.md)

> [!NOTE]
> v2.0 introduces two **additional** daemons alongside the v1 ops-daemon documented here: the **recap-daemon** ([`recap.md`](recap.md)) and the **account-rotation daemon** ([`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md#6-multi-account-claude-max-rotator)). The ops-daemon described below is unchanged in v2.

The **ops-daemon** is a unified background process manager that runs persistently via macOS launchd. It replaced per-service launchd agents (introduced in v0.5.0, expanded in v1.1.0).

> [!NOTE]
> As of **v1.1.0**, the daemon installs at **setup Step 2c** (not 5b) so it begins pre-warming the briefing cache while the rest of setup is still running. By the time you finish configuring integrations, `/ops:go` is already instant.

---

## 🧭 What the Daemon Does

The daemon supervises **seven** long-lived services:

| Service | Cadence | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `briefing-pre-warm` | every **2 min** | Runs `bin/ops-gather` to keep `/ops:go` cache hot |
| `whatsapp-bridge-sync` | persistent | Keeps WhatsApp connected, auto-reconnects, backfills `@lid` chats |
| `memory-extractor` | every 30 min | Spawns `memory-extractor` agent to refresh `memories/` |
| `inbox-digest` | every 15 min | Pre-classifies comms across channels for `/ops:inbox` |
| `store-health` | every 10 min | Shopify orders + inventory polling (if configured) |
| `competitor-intel` | hourly | Background market/competitor monitoring |
| `message-listener` | persistent | Surfaces urgent patterns (your name, "urgent", "ASAP", "fire", "down") |

> [!TIP]
> The `briefing-pre-warm` service is what makes `/ops:go` feel instant. It runs `bin/ops-gather` every 2 minutes so the cache is always <2 min stale when you ask.

---

## ⚡ The Pre-Warm Strategy

Installing the daemon at **setup Step 2c** is a deliberate optimisation. While you're still clicking through OAuth prompts and pasting API keys in Steps 3–7, the daemon is already warming your briefing cache in the background.

    participant User
    participant Setup as /ops:setup
    participant Daemon as ops-daemon
    participant PreWarm as briefing-pre-warm
    participant Cache as daemon-cache.json
    participant Go as /ops:go

    User->>Setup: start setup wizard
    Setup->>Setup: Step 1 — detect environment
    Setup->>Setup: Step 2a — install CLIs
    Setup->>Setup: Step 2b — configure secrets manager
    Setup->>Daemon: Step 2c — INSTALL DAEMON (early!)
    activate Daemon
    Daemon->>PreWarm: spawn briefing-pre-warm
    Note over Daemon,PreWarm: Daemon is live before<br/>setup completes

    par Setup continues
        Setup->>Setup: Steps 3–7 — integrations, registry, smoke tests
    and Pre-warm loops
        loop every 2 min
            PreWarm->>Cache: bin/ops-gather → write cache
        end
    end

    Setup->>Setup: Step 5b — daemon service reconciliation
    Note right of Setup: Step 5b is now<br/>RECONCILE (not fresh install)
    Setup->>Daemon: reconcile service set
    Setup-->>User: setup complete

    User->>Go: /ops:go
    Go->>Cache: read daemon-cache.json
    Cache-->>Go: <2 min fresh data
    Go-->>User: briefing in ~1s
    deactivate Daemon
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Step 5b changed in v1.1.0.** It used to be "install daemon + launchd plist" (fresh install). It is now "**daemon service reconciliation**" — the daemon is already running from Step 2c; Step 5b just reconciles the active service set with whatever integrations the user configured in Steps 3–7 (enables `store-health` only if Shopify was configured, etc.).

---

## 🛠️ Setup

The daemon is configured automatically by the setup wizard:

```
/ops:setup
# Step 2c: Install ops-daemon + briefing-pre-warm (early install)
# Step 5b: Daemon service reconciliation (enable/disable per integration)
```

Or manage it manually:

```bash
# Start via launchd (recommended — survives reboots)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.daemon.plist

# Start foreground (debug mode)
~/.claude/plugins/cache/ops-marketplace/ops/<version>/scripts/ops-daemon.sh start

# Check status
~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../scripts/ops-daemon.sh status

# List active services
~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../scripts/ops-daemon.sh services
```

The daemon script lives at `scripts/ops-daemon.sh`.

> [!TIP]
> Run `/ops:doctor` anytime the daemon misbehaves. It diagnoses missing plists, stale PIDs, failed services, and reconciles the service set for you.

---

## 📋 Health File Contract

The daemon writes `~/.whatsapp-bridge/.health` on every successful whatsapp-bridge sync. Skills read this file before any WhatsApp operation.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "last_sync": "2026-04-13T07:45:00Z",
  "wacli_pid": 12345,
  "message_count": 1420
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `status` | `ok`, `degraded`, or `down` |
| `last_sync` | ISO timestamp of last successful whatsapp-bridge poll |
| `wacli_pid` | PID of the running whatsapp-bridge process |
| `message_count` | Total messages in local DB |

> [!WARNING]
> If `last_sync` is more than **10 minutes** ago, the PreToolUse hook surfaces a warning before any WhatsApp command. Running `/ops:doctor` will auto-restart the daemon if this happens.

---

## 🪝 PreToolUse Hook

`hooks/whatsapp-health-check.sh` runs automatically before any `whatsapp-bridge` call. It checks the health file and either:
- Proceeds silently if `status === ok` and `last_sync` is recent
- Surfaces a warning with instructions to restart the daemon if degraded

The hook is registered in `.claude/settings.json` under `preToolUse`.

---

## 🧠 Brain Layer

The daemon includes a lightweight brain layer (`bin/ops-brain`) that:
- Pre-fetches briefing data every **2 minutes** via `briefing-pre-warm` and caches it to `~/.claude/plugins/data/.../daemon-cache.json`
- Detects urgent message patterns (mentions of your name, "urgent", "ASAP", "fire", "down")
- Writes urgent flags to the health file so `/ops:go` can surface them instantly

This makes `/ops:go` load in under **3 seconds** instead of gathering data live (typically ~1s off a hot cache).

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

```bash
# View daemon logs
tail -f /tmp/com.claude-ops.daemon.log

# View a specific service's logs
tail -f /tmp/com.claude-ops.briefing-pre-warm.log
tail -f /tmp/com.claude-ops.memory-extractor.log

# Force restart
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.daemon.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.daemon.plist

# Run doctor to auto-fix daemon issues
/ops:doctor
```

Common issues:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `whatsapp-bridge not connected` | Auth expired | `/ops:setup whatsapp` to re-authenticate |
| `health file stale` | Daemon crashed | Check `/tmp/com.claude-ops.daemon.log`, restart via launchctl |
| `memory extractor not running` | Missing Haiku API key | Configure in preferences or Doppler |
| `briefing-pre-warm errors` | `bin/ops-gather` failing | Run `bin/ops-gather` manually to see the error, often a missing CLI |
| `Step 5b keeps re-enabling stopped services` | Expected — reconciliation enables anything configured | Use `ops-daemon.sh disable <service>` to opt out |

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't manually delete `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.daemon.plist` while the daemon is running — launchctl will leave orphan processes. Always `launchctl unload` first, then remove the plist.
